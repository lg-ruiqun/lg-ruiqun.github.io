## Work collaboratively with plaintiffs not included in the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement

### Definition

Courts should discuss with indigenous people on the issues raised by those who attended residential schools but have not been included in the 2008 settlement (referred to as “the settlement” later).

### Current Progress

Although the Prime Minister has apologized to Residential School students and their families have been given money for compensation, these families are still suing for language loss.

### Assessing Progress

We use special cases for assessing the progress of this Call to Action.

#### Timber Bay

He held private residential schools, and those students who attended that school did not receive compensation (Not done) (Laskowski 2019).

#### Île-à-la-Crosse students

Those students were denied from the settlement, but got the same right as the First Nations indigenous people in May 2019 (Done) (Pearce 2021).

### Why we need this Call to Action

Some Indigenous people thought that they haven’t received enough consideration and relief for their suffering from residential schools. In 1996 the last residential school was closed by the government, but many survivors are excluded from this settlement (Miller 2012). They thought that all those who suffered from residential schools, including themselves, should be given those compensations.

When the colonizers realized that they could never civilize Canada, they had to keep a racist country towards indigenous people and start indigenous schools (Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada 2015). Beginning in the late 1800s, the Canadian government's Department of Indian Affairs (DIA) officially encouraged the growth of the residential school system as a valuable component in a wider policy of integrating Indigenous people into European Canadian society (Catherine E. 2014).

Overall, we needed residential schools because we wanted indigenous people to better get involved in the European community. Later when we realized that this is not mandatory, we stopped residential schools, but didn’t pay much attention to the indigenous people that suffered from this period of studying.

### Stakeholders

#### Main people affected by this Call to Action

The issue is mainly between the Federal Government and indigenous people excluded from the settlement.

#### Others’ support

To commemorate the indigenous people, we set up the National Truth and Reconciliation Day. On this day, many people in Canada wear orange clothes to celebrate the ongoing work on residential schools.
