In 1996 the last residential school was closed by the government, but many survivors are excluded from this settlement (Miller 2012). They thought that all those who suffered from residential schools, including themselves, should be given those compensations.</span></p><p><span>When the colonizers realized that they could never civilize Canada, they had to keep a racist country towards indigenous people and start indigenous schools (Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada 2015). Beginning in the late 1800s, the Canadian government&#39;s Department of Indian Affairs (DIA) officially encouraged the growth of the residential school system as a valuable component in a wider policy of integrating Indigenous people into European Canadian society (Catherine E. 2014).</span></p><p><span>Overall, we needed residential schools because we wanted indigenous people to better get involved in the European community. Later when we realized that this is not mandatory, we stopped residential schools, but didn’t pay much attention to the indigenous people that suffered from this period of studying.</span></p><h3 id='stakeholders'><span>Stakeholders</span></h3><h4 id='main-people-affected-by-this-call-to-action'><span>Main people affected by this Call to Action</span></h4><p><span>The issue is mainly between the Federal Government and indigenous people excluded from the settlement.</span></p><h4 id='others-support'><span>Others’ support</span></h4><p><span>To commemorate the indigenous people, we set up the National Truth and Reconciliation Day.
